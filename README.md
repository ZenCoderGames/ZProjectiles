# ZEventTree-ZTween
An extendable event tree meant to make sequences and parallel events easier to do in Unity. Works with ZTween.

There are two main folders in the Scripts folder :

ZEvent
- All code related to event trees, event nodes...

ZTween
- All code related to tweening, easing...


There is also a Tests folder which has a test script to show you how each of these systems work.
